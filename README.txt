# Wearable

## Overview

A wearable device consisting of a single potentiostat was developed as the final measuring system (the first was a prototype). This wearable incorporates parts from the prototype and is intended to perform electrochemical (square wave voltammetry) sweat analysis and output the exact molar concentration of MTXby using the Gaussian fit and pH algorithm.

## Features

- **Temperature Measurement**: Integrated temperature sensor for real-time monitoring and calibration during experiments.
- **Voltammetry (Potentiostats)**: potentiostats for conducting electrochemical analysis using square wave voltammetry.


## Getting Started

Open a serial monitor and use the following settings: baud rate 115200, 8 data bits, 1 stop bit and no parity.
